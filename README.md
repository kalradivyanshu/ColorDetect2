# ColorDetect2
This is a better version of https://github.com/kalradivyanshu/ColorDetect, this one uses opencv for python3.

It detects the color of the object infront of the webcam and then send that information to Arduino which lights an RGB-LED to that color. Right now it can detect yellow, pink, red, green and blue.

Usage:

cd path-to-main.py

python3 main.py /dev/ttyACM0
